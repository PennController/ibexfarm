<h2>Syncing from a git repo</h2>
<p>
This is pretty straightforward, but there are a few things
to know:
</p>
<ul class="githelp">
<li>There is no git repository hosted on the ibex farm server. The method used is rather braindead:
the repository is checked out, and the files are then copied over to your experiment. Files that
already exist will be overwritten; files which are uploaded to your experiment but which are not in the repository will remain unaltered.
</li>
<li>
No files are ever copied to the &lsquo;results&rsquo; dir, in order to ensure that
results are never overwritten by accident.
</li>
<li>
The repository checkout will time out after [% timeout %] seconds. If this happens,
you can just try again. That is, unless you are trying to check out an enormous
repo, in which case you'll have to slim it down a bit.
</li>
<li>
Your git repo should have the directories &lsquo;data_includes&rsquo;,
&lsquo;js_includes&rsquo;, etc. in its root directory. Only files immediately
contained in these directories will be copied over &mdash; subdirectories
are ignored.
</li>
<li>
Currently, it is only possible to sync from publicly readable git repos.
</li>
</ul>
